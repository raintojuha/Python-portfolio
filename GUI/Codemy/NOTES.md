Codemy GUI course
===
These projects have been made by following along Codemy.com YouTube course on Python GUI using TKinter. These are made for the purpose of learning how to make graphical user interfaces with Python. While not fully 'made by me', I aim to understand every line of code and hopefully that will show in the comments.

This course is 183 videos long so we'll see if I'll complete all of these projects.
