Image Viewer
===
I made the Image Viewer into an Class from the begining this time.

I also stopped the video less than half way through since it clicked on me how to complete the project.

I divided the project into more functions than the tutorial since I belive it is necessary and makes the code more readable.

This project is finished to the point that I don't have to revisit it later.

Only improvement I can think of is that the program would read all images in a given folder, since currently the file paths are baked into the code.
